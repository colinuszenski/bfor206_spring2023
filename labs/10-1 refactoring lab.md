# BFOR 206 Lab
## Class 10-1: Get Comments and Refactor


# Task Description

In this lab, we will refactor the code from the previous labs
and add new functionality to get comments from Reddit and 
store them in a dataframe.


You will need three functions:

1. A function to get the authorization token from Reddit.
2. A function to get posts from a subreddit.
3. A function to get comments from a post.

You then need to be able to call the functions. See the updated 
code on the course github page for how to build and call the
functions.

# Test Cases

## Case 1
Show that you can run the functions. Print the shape of the
comments dataframe.

**Expected Output:**
```

Successful app authentication: True
(143, 5)

```

# Submission instructions

**Scripts that produce unhandled errors will not be accepted!**


When you are finished, show the instructor that
that you can run the functions and produce output that
looks very similar to the output in the test cases.
