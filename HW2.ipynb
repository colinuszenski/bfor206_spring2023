Everytime confidential files are declassified we get to see more and more proof that our government has been spying on us and commiting horrible crimes against U.S. Citizens. Snowden wasn't the first case of proof just the largest spotlight shone on this stuff. If you still believe it's just a conspiracy theory, I challenge to do some research. It's available and not from nut job websites but through government sites. My personal belief is due to America becoming more and more of a melting pot, and more religions sowing roots here, they needed a new format of control over the masses. There is no stronger, proven way to control man better than control of his Fear. If the fear of eternal damnation no longer works what's the next best thing. The fear that our leadership is betraying us. Man will go to great lengths to avoid fear, to the point you can literally give them documented proof and believing it scares them so much they not only write it off but completely tune themselves out from the facts. So they ignore it and choose to chase the carrot while being whipped from behind, subconsciously convincing themselves there is no master with a whip, but that they are chasing the carrot by free will. Never realizing the cart they are towing is filled with the facts they deny.\n",

It's well established that pay growth in most industries, in early career, grows faster when you jump from company to company taking a series of small promotions along the way. I have a friend who did this is banking after dropping out of community college where he studied music. You get the first job in your knees, then interview your butt off for the next, and so on and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing you have to do is build out for professional licensing, certification,.etc.for the field you choose. These are better and mote specific than degrees for a variety of fields. Can't understate this enough, get them all and get the hardest ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, network your ass off. 90% of business revolves around the people we already know. For the field you wish to work, you had better find a way to become one of these people. It's shockingly easy to do most of the time, but involves a ton of work most people hate. Go do those meet up things, the young professional things, whatever your field doors for seminars and actually MEET people in a meaningful way. Meet them so you know them and can call them in the future. \n",

This creates a sort of contempt that comes out in his style.\n",

      "\n",
      "As a result, there's this musical form of his that's neither opera, nor works well with Broadway musical structure. Rather than being both, it falls short of being definitively either. Musically (meaning the underlying theory), it's actually pretty interesting, some of the stuff he does--I mean, the Phantom fanfare is straight up iconic. But add lyrics to it and a good deal of it struggles to maintain cohesion. Add an overarcing *narrative* atop that, and the whole thing comes apart at the seams.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so you see in a lot of Webber's work that, well, let's just ignore that narrative part...or, all of the stuff that makes the modern musical *not* opera. Cats is kind of notorius for this, but even Phantom is kind of weak, and then there's Starlight Express (oh god, Starlight Express...).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you could say that's a fault of a weak book (the not-musical stuff in a musical), but if you look at Webber musicals for the most part, the book is even less existant than many of his contemporaries, even in stuff with \"more\" narrative like Jesus Christ Superstar, Phantom, ~~Les Mis~~, and so on, which is why I say that Webber was wishing he could write operas, and chooses not to, for reasons I can only guess at. It isn't until fucking *School of Rock* that you actually see narrative make a presence in his work in a way that works with the music rather than seemingly struggle against it, and by show of hands, how many people knew Webber did the music for the stage version of SoR (which was changed for or from the movie version)?\n",
      "\n",
      "And just for the record, I do think Webber has some great moments.

It's very similar to the Daily Show in that it's a combination of humor and commentary. But there's perhaps even more of an emphasis on the commentary side of it because he spends way more time on single subject matters than John Stewart. \n",

These aren't issues many people talk about on television, and he's using humor to bring it to peoples' attention. And he's being relatively thorough about it. It's not a 10 second joke with a punch-line, but a 20-minute discussion. I work in the criminal justice field, and my non-lawyer friends don't normally care about this shit. But he comes out with a bit and suddenly friends and family are contacting me, asking questions. That's a good thing.\n",
